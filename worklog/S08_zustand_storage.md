# S08 Refactor Script Storage to Zustand

## Feature Requirement
Refactor script storage to use Zustand store instead of local React state, to improve state management and code organization.

## System Design
1. Move script state and operations to Zustand store
2. Update UI components to use Zustand store
3. Keep chrome.storage.local as persistence layer
4. Ensure proper error handling and loading states

## Implementation Details
1. Created Script interface in types folder
2. Created scriptStore with all script operations
3. Updated all components to use the new store
4. Removed local state management (useScripts hook and ScriptManager)
5. Maintained chrome.storage.local as persistence layer
6. Added proper error handling and loading states

## Tasks
[X] Task 1: Create script store

- Added proper error handling and loading states

[X] Task 2: Update UI components
- Updated ScriptList to use script store
- Updated ScriptEditor to use script store
- Updated Panel to use script store
- Removed useScripts hook

[X] Task 3: Clean up and testing

- Verified all script operations work
- Verified persistence works
- Checked error handling
