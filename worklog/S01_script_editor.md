# Story: Implement Basic Script Editor in Sidebar

## Requirements
- Add a script editor in the Chrome extension's sidebar
- Editor should be a simple textarea initially
- Include a save button to save the script
- Saved script should be activated like a userscript (similar to Violentmonkey)

## System Design
1. UI Components:
   - Sidebar panel with textarea for script editing
   - Save button below the textarea
   - Basic styling with TailwindCSS

2. Data Flow:
   - Script content stored in Chrome storage
   - When saved, script will be injected into active tab
   - Background script will handle script activation

3. Technical Considerations:
   - Use React for UI components
   - Chrome storage sync for persistence
   - Content script injection for script execution

## Implementation Details
1. UI Implementation:
   - Created script editor in Panel.tsx using textarea
   - Added save button with proper styling
   - Used TailwindCSS for responsive design
   - Implemented script storage using chrome.storage.sync
   - Added script execution using chrome.scripting.executeScript

2. Permissions:
   - Added required permissions in manifest.json:
     - scripting: for script execution
     - storage: for saving scripts
     - tabs: for accessing tab information
     - windows: for side panel management
   - Added host_permissions for <all_urls>

3. Side Panel Handling:
   - Initialize side panel on extension installation/update
   - Direct side panel opening in response to user click
   - Proper handling of Chrome's user gesture requirements
   - Improved reliability of side panel operations

## Test Plan
